###Exercises
Please submit your answers to the following questions in a file called intro_to_clean_coding_answers.txt.

>In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.
A: Clean code allows for ease of use and collaboration with other developers. Furthermore, it can also facilitate debugging and future updating of functionality.

>Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard.
A: Simple examples of other things that run on computers include traffic lights. California traffic lights sometimes leverage sensors at intersections to detect if there is a car waiting. Errors here may result in significant accidents and loss of life if traffic lights did not function correctly.

>Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

FUNCTION do(x, y)               // Creating a new function
 IF y = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
 SET z to (xâˆ’32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 ELSE IF y = "C" THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION

A: No, I would not consider this clean. Variables are not descriptive and it also does the work of 2 separate functions. See below:

FUNCTION convertToFahrenheit(temperatureInCelsius)
  SET temperatureInFahrenheit = temperatureInCelsius * 1.8 + 32
  RETURN temperatureInFahrenheit
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION convertToCelsius(temperatureInFahrenheit)
  SET temperatureInCelsius = (temperatureInFahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
  RETURN temperatureInCelsius
END FUNCTION

>Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION

A: This code is relatively clean, the only thing I would change is the function name from "calcPercent" to "calculatePercentage"

>Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the principles you have learned in this checkpoint.

a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and receives payment accordingly.

FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   END IF
END FUNCTION

A:
FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
  SET total = subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

   PRINT "Your total due is: " total

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - total
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " total
   END IF
END FUNCTION


b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the guest's account.

FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive THEN
     IF NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) THEN
         IF guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
           APPEND book to guest.books
           SET book.status to "Checked Out"
           PRINT "Your books have been issued."
         END IF
     END IF
 ELSE
     PRINT "Unable to check out book."
 END IF
END FUNCTION

A:
FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive AND NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) AND (guest.outstandingFees = 0) THEN
     APPEND book to guest.books
     SET book.status to "Checked Out"
     PRINT "Your books have been issued."
 ELSE
     PRINT "Unable to check out book."
 END IF
END FUNCTION

c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions a customer can perform at an ATM.

CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 ....
 ....
 ....

END

A:
CLASS BalanceOperations

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION
END

CLASS CreditCard
 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION
END

CLASS CheckingAccount
 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION
END


Programming Questions
You may do the following problems in any language of your choice. Use the clean code principles taught in this section while writing the code.

6. Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root, otherwise return the sum.

Example:
[10,1,4,6,1,1,2] returns 5 because the square root of 25 is 5.
[1,1] returns 2 because 2 is not a perfect square.
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414213562373095.

A:
function sumNumbers(integers) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= integers.length; i++) {
    total = total + integers[i];
  }
  return total;
}

function findSumSquare(integers) {
  total = sumNumbers(integers);
  squareRoot = Math.sqrt(total);
  if (squareRoot % 1 == 0) {
    return squareRoot;
  } else {
    return total;
  }
}

7. Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

function isDuplicated(integers) {
  if (integers.length != 1) {
    let firstInteger = integers[0];
    integers.shift();
    for (let i = 0; i <= integers.length; i++) {
      if (i == firstInteger) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    isDuplicated(integers);
  } else {
  return false;
  }
}

8. Anagram An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, spar can be formed from rasp. Given two strings, stringOne and stringTwo, determine if stringOne is an anagram of stringTwo. Assume that the strings contain only lowercase letters and do not worry about case-sensitivity. Hint: Your first task will be to convert the strings to arrays.
