###Short Answer
> Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode is used to create a framework or algorithm to solve a certain problem without coding. This allows the developer to focus on finding a solution rather than syntax issues. Additionally, it allows multiple people to collaborate on a problem without all of them needing to understand technical languages.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Pseudocode will not run on a computer because it is meant for humans to understand, not machines.

###Programming Assignment
> Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

- Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
  RETURN first number
ELSE
  RETURN second number

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR numbers between 1 to 100
  RETURN number
END FOR LOOP

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT a search query
WHILE the entry IS NOT search query
  Go to next entry
END WHILE
RETURN entry

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

//Javascript
phoneBook = [entry1, entry2, entry3, entry4]

function phoneSearch(query) {
  let i = 0;
  while (phoneBook[i] != query) {
    if (i < phoneBook.length) {
      i++;
    } else {
      return "Cannot find entry";
    }
  }
  return phoneBook[i]
}
