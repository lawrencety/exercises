Short Answer
> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: Looking for a parking spot. Typically, for street parking, you have to search one spot at a time until you find an empty spot.

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: Finding a book on a shelf assuming the shelf is alphabetically sorted. Can start in the middle and divide until the book is found.

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: 7

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: 3

> Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose linear search because the collection is unsorted, thus binary search would not be able to yield an accurate result.

> Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose binary search because the collection is sorted, thus binary search would be more efficient than linear search and would get an accurate result.

Programming Assignment:
> You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
A:
//since the dictionary is an ordered set of items, we can leverage binary search for an efficient search.
//let dictionary = ['a',...]

function searchDictionary(word) {
  let low = 0;
  let high = (dictionary.length - 1);
  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if (dictionary[mid] < word) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return 'Not Found'
}

//We can also search the dictionary linearly which may result in a faster search since "Albatross" is close to the beginning of the dictionary, but I am opting for a more universally effective algorithm

> You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
//since this is an unordered set of items, we will need to use linear search algorithm for this
//let fish = ['fish1',...]

function searchTank(target) {
  for (i = 0; i < fish.length; i++) {
    if (fish[i] == target) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return 'Not Found';
}
