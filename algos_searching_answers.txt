Short Answer
> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: Looking for a parking spot. Typically, for street parking, you have to search one spot at a time until you find an empty spot.

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: Finding a book on a shelf assuming the shelf is alphabetically sorted. Can start in the middle and divide until the book is found.

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: 7

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: 3

> Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose linear search because the collection is unsorted, thus binary search would not be able to yield an accurate result.

> Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose binary search because the collection is sorted, thus binary search would be more efficient than linear search and would get an accurate result.
