> Let's get some practice creating a database and using pqsl.

    Create a database called library using the appropriate Postgres command line tools.
    Download and execute this file in the database: Library Data
    Run the following query using psql to confirm that the data was imported correctly. Create a gist with the results and submit the answers.

  SELECT * FROM books;

  library=# SELECT * FROM books;
  id  |                  title                   |       author
